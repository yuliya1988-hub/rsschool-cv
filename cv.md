What about me, I would like to change my professional sphere from logistics to IT. I strongly believe in prospects of this way. Now I don't see any advantages of current job except money. But it's not my way to work only for good salary. 

All my life I used to achieve my goals whatever it was. So I strongly believe in my future in IT. My hard-working skills with ambitions and passion to all that I do will help me to achieve new one.

My skills:
* HTML-basics
* CSS-basics

I was graduated Belarussian State Economic University as Master in Economy and Commerce. But I haven't worked b my speciality, I started my carrer in logistics. All courses I heard were dedicated to sales, professional and-development, etc.
Now I'm studying in RS-School.

My English level is B2. I've not had enough practice during latest 4-5 years, so I take individual lessons with teacher by Skype, futhermore I learning English in Skyeng.
